Here's a video that demonstrates progress on the prototype so far.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /><object id="BLOG_video-a1f4706cff307735" class="BLOG_video_class" contentid="a1f4706cff307735" width="320" height="266" ></object></div><br /><br />This video shows the following features functioning properly<br /><br /><b>Basic Software - </b>Both the Arduino and Pi are running infinite loops to check for button presses and received packets, as well as writing data to files if the need arises.<br /><br /><b>Custom Communication Protocol transmitted via Xbee</b> - the start signal was transmitted from the Arduino in a custom designed packet that was then decoded by the finish line. This packet included a checksum to verify the packet's integrity<br /><br /><b>Flask Web Server </b>- the Pi is hosting a web server that successfully responds to GET requests made to it with JSON files that represent racing results so far.<br /><br /><b>App for Retrieving Results - </b>The Android phone is running a custom made app that makes http requests to the pi and then formats the results to display racer results so far.<br /><br /><br />
