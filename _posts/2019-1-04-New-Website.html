We have a new website! We've moved from Blogger to a custom domain at ThwackTimingGate.com.
This new website makes it easier to accompany text with code and organize our resources in a way that is more conducive to proper documentation.
The hope is this furthers the open-source goal of the project and makes it even easier for others to see the work we're doing and build on it.

Check out all the cool new parts of the site by using the sidebar to the left.
