Back from Summer break and hoping to make some progress this Fall<br /><br />The challenge to take on today was one that is at the center of the functionality of the timing gate: wireless communication between two remote hosts. We had previously decided that are hosts would be an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi 3, using Xbees to relay information wirelessly, but making them all work togethor is another issue. To begin, we simply tackled the issue of communicating to the Arduino from a normal computer. This was the easiest way to test our Xbees, as a graphical interface is provided for Windows, and Arduinos have extensive documentation for Xbee functionality.
