This website hosts the work of two students at Freeport High School—Paul Biberstein and Jacob Selian—as they design and construct the **Thwack Timing Gate**, a cheap, open-source, wireless timing system for alpine skiing.

What is the Thwack Timing Gate exactly? Well, the idea started back in the Winter of 2018. The two high school students, both avid members of Freeport High School's alpine ski race team, found themselves training late into the night at Lost Valley ski mountain. Nocturnal practices were required, as the few days of the week the team could secure a bus to make the 40 minute journey to the mountain needed to be maximized, so they would spend hours on the mountain, racing through a ragtag set of 20 or so slalom gates, then going back up the lift and doing it again.
