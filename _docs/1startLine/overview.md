The start line is rather simple: its only job is to allow racers to **input their ID number** and **send the start signal** to the finish line when the start wand is tripped

This is accomplished with a minimal bill of matierals. Besides general electrical prototyping resources and 3d printed parts (which can be found in the next section), here is what you will need:
1. [Arduino Uno](arduinoLink)
  1. [Xbee Arduino Shield](shieldLink)
1. [2.4 Ghz Xbee](xbeeLink) with compatible [RPSMA Antenna](antennaLink)
1. [9 Button Keypad](keypadLink)
1. Micro Switch (triggerable with 0.005N-m of torque)
1. Extensible Spring (Approximately 1/4" x 7/8")

> This Xbee works over 4000 feet with line of sight. If you need less distance, others can be substituted to save on cost. Just make sure you find a compatible antenna!


> Syncing contacts with your phone restores any previously synced contacts.

To sync your contacts:

1. Open your *User Settings* on your phone app
2. Select the **Sync Contacts** button
3. Authorise ChatApp permissions
4. Select some or all of your contacts
